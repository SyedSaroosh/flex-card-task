<DOCUMENTATION
 IN THIS FLEX CARD OUR TARGET WAS TO PLACE THE MAIN-CARD  IN THE CENTER OF THE PAGE  BY USING DISPLAY-FLEX PROPERTY. SO AS YOU CAN SEE THAT FOR THIS TASK I FIRST  CREATED A "MAIN DIV " AND THEN NASTED ANOTHER "DIV BY NAME CARD COVER"  AN DIN IT I AGAIN CREATED A DIB :BY NAME CARD , WHICH I WANT TO PLACE AT THE CENTER OF THE PAGE AND IN IT I PLACED AN COVER IMAGE AND THEN USDE AN "SPAN-TAG "BY NAME OF CARD-RIGHT-SECTION"  FOR HEADING ,PARAGRAPH  AND CARD FOOTER SECTION", AND IN  'CARD RIGHT SECTION ' I HAD CREATED ANOTHER DIV"BY NAME OF CRAD FOOTER SECTION " WHERE HAD PLACED TO IMAGESS AND AN NAME TAG   

NOW SOME MAIN KEY POINTS --- THE HEIGHT OF MAIN IS GIEVN BY 110VH BCZ 100% HEIGHT IS OF NO USE IN IT .
 I HAD ONLY USE PADDING LESS TO 20PX..
 I HAD ONLY USE ONE MARGIN OF 90PX WHICH I HAS TO SOUGHT IUT THAT HOW CAN I FIX IT IN FOOTER SECTION OF MAIN CARD.
 I HAD NOT USED ANY ICON .
 I HAD ONLY USE THREE DISPLAY FLEX IN EVERY DIV AND I THINKS THIS IS AN BIG BLUNDER OR I HAD NOT APPLIED DISPLAY FLEX CORRECTLY/>
